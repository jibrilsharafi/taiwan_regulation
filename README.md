# Taiwan Regulation: Advanced SOC Management

This project focuses on the State of Charge (SOC) management of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to provide frequency regulation to the Taiwan grid. It also features peak shaving.

## Files in this Project

- [`EdReg_study_advanced_SOC_mgnt.m`](EdReg_study_advanced_SOC_mgnt.m): This MATLAB script contains the main logic for the advanced SOC management study.

- [`simulationEdReg.m`](simulationEdReg.m): This MATLAB script is used to simulate the SOC management system.

- [`studyDistribution_f.m`](studyDistribution_f.m): This MATLAB script is used to study the distribution of frequency.

- [`ProfiliHoping.mat`](ProfiliHoping.mat): This MATLAB data file contains the frequency profiles used in the project.

## How to Run

To run the project, you need to have MATLAB installed on your machine. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory. Run the `EdReg_study_advanced_SOC_mgnt.m` script to start the SOC management study.
